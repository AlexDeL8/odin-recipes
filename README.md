## General Information
- This is the **Odin Recipes project** to practice what was learned in the **HTML Foundations** section of the **Foundations** portion in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)
    - The requirements of this projects included ustilizing multiple tags learned to create a proper recipe layout (i.e. headings, lists, divs, and text tags)
    - I made the decsion to also include modals to make this project function like a single-page app when viewing recipes (versus the original project specs that said to use seperate HTML files)
- View the app HERE ((GitHub Page TBD))


## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Flexbox, JavaScript


## Features
- Single Page App that displays a static set of recipes with modals


## Room for Improvement
- Add animations for smoother transitions between modals showing/hiding
- Paging within the modal without having to click-out to view next recipe
- Ability to add/remove recipies


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by and based on the courses provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)
